# Motor Dyno
## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1 Project Name
> STEPPER MOTOR DYNO

### 1.2 Description
> a dyno designed to test the parameters of nema17(17HS8401S/17HS4401S) and check speed torque characteristics 

### 1.3 Goals & Objectives
GOALS:
- Evaluate and compare different NEMA17 stepper motors to determine their performance differences.
- Identify the best-performing motor based on key parameters such as torque, efficiency, heat generation, and noise levels.
- Help  engineers and hobbyists make an informed decision when selecting a NEMA17 stepper motor for 3d printers.
OBJECTIVES:
  -Test multiple NEMA17 stepper motors from different manufacturers.
  - Measure and analyze key performance metrics
  - Compare real-world performance vs. manufacturer specifications.
  - Provide practical insights and recommendations for choosing the best motor based on specific applications.
### 1.4 Key Features
Stepper motors tested:
- Hanpose stepper motors 17HS8401S and 17HS4401S are being tested.
perfromance parameters:
- Torque output
- voltage and current under increasing breaking force.
